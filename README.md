# Computational Musicology 2020

Computational musicology, week 6

I would like to compare Dutch Carnivals music to today's top hits. I think this is interesting because, in my opinion, carnavals music always gets people in a good mood. I also think it's interesting because the genres, subjects and even the vibes are very different. A lot of people can sing the songs in both the lists along (maybe only the people that live in the south of the Netherlands can sing along with the carnival music though). I'm very curious to see what's the difference between the two.

For my corpus, I used two Spotify playlist, Vasteloavend 2020 and Today's Top Hits. Both the playlist consist of songs that are currently most popular. As measured by Spotify, carnivals music has a much higher valence (M = 0.768, SD = 0.195) than the top hits (M = 0.495, SD = 0.208). The mode of carinals music, overall, seems to be more major (M = 0.963, SD = 0.189) than the top hits (M = 0.54, SD = 0.503).

The carnival music also has a much higher energy (M = 0.792, SD = 0.120), compared to the hits (M = 0.587, SD = 0.158). Interesting to see is that the liveness of today's hits (M = 1.73, SD = 0.142) is much higher than the carnival music (M = 0.222, SD = 0.161). I think these findings are also something to look into, because maybe it is possible to find a reason for it.
